To support the common frontend of different languages which Maple targets, a
tool which can ease the parsing of languages is strongly needed. The tool is
supposed to handle most of the language features. This is 'autogen'.

Here is the workflow of this common frontend.

1. Autogen takes the .spec files as input and parse them. Each language will
   define its own set of .spec files.
2. Autogen generates a set of .h files, which are mainly composed of tables.
   The tables are C version of the rules defined in .spec files.
   The generated .h files will be located in directory of each language, such
   as java/include/*.h.
3. The tables tell rules of language syntax

These genereted .h files will be further included in the language parsers,
which generate an automata based on these tables (aka, syntax rules), to drive
the parsing of a program.

==== Two types of info in .spec

1. STRUCT
   This will be generated as a table whose data structure could be varied according
   to what type of syntax it's describing. Take a look at separator.spec and 
   gen_separator.cpp/h for example.

2. RULE
   This will be generated as a set of rule tables. Rule tables have unified data
   structure defined in ruletable.h.
