// Java has a rule 'Definite Assignment'.
// This case is from JLS 8.
//
//  Definite Assignment Does Not Consider Values of Expressions
//even though the value of n is known at compile time, and in principle it can be known at
//compile time that the assignment to k will always be executed (more properly, evaluated).
//A Java compiler must operate according to the rules laid out in this section. The rules
//recognize only constant expressions; in this example, the expression n > 2 is not a constant
//expression as defined in ยง15.28.

class Point {
  final int x;
  int foo() {
    int k;
    int n = 5;
    if (n > 2)
      k = 3;
    System.out.println(k); /* k is not "definitely assigned" before this statement */
  }
