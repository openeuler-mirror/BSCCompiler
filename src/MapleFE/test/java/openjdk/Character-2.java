/**
 * The {@code Character} class wraps a value of the primitive
 * type {@code char} in an object. An object of type
 * {@code Character} contains a single field whose type is
 * {@code char}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, this class provides several methods for determining
 * a character's category (lowercase letter, digit, etc.) and for converting
 * characters from uppercase to lowercase and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * Character information is based on the Unicode Standard, version 6.2.0.
 * <p>
 * The methods and data of class {@code Character} are defined by
 * the information in the <i>UnicodeData</i> file that is part of the
 * Unicode Character Database maintained by the Unicode
 * Consortium. This file specifies various properties including name
 * and general category for every defined Unicode code point or
 * character range.
 * <p>
 * The file and its description are available from the Unicode Consortium at:
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3><a name="unicode">Unicode Character Representations</a></h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@code char} data type (and therefore the value that a
 * {@code Character} object encapsulates) are based on the
 * original Unicode specification, which defined characters as
 * fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been
 * changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
 * than 16 bits.  The range of legal <em>code point</em>s is now
 * U+0000 to U+10FFFF, known as <em>Unicode scalar value</em>.
 * (Refer to the <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr27/#notation"><i>
 * definition</i></a> of the U+<i>n</i> notation in the Unicode
 * Standard.)
 *
 * <p><a name="BMP">The set of characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF</a> is
 * sometimes referred to as the <em>Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)</em>.
 * <a name="supplementary">Characters</a> whose code points are greater
 * than U+FFFF are called <em>supplementary character</em>s.  The Java
 * platform uses the UTF-16 representation in {@code char} arrays and
 * in the {@code String} and {@code StringBuffer} classes. In
 * this representation, supplementary characters are represented as a pair
 * of {@code char} values, the first from the <em>high-surrogates</em>
 * range, (&#92;uD800-&#92;uDBFF), the second from the
 * <em>low-surrogates</em> range (&#92;uDC00-&#92;uDFFF).
 *
 * <p>A {@code char} value, therefore, represents Basic
 * Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate
 * code points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An
 * {@code int} value represents all Unicode code points,
 * including supplementary code points. The lower (least significant)
 * 21 bits of {@code int} are used to represent Unicode code
 * points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.
 * Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to
 * supplementary characters and surrogate {@code char} values is
 * as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The methods that only accept a {@code char} value cannot support
 * supplementary characters. They treat {@code char} values from the
 * surrogate ranges as undefined characters. For example,
 * {@code Character.isLetter('\u005CuD840')} returns {@code false}, even though
 * this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
 * would represent a letter.
 *
 * <li>The methods that accept an {@code int} value support all
 * Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For
 * example, {@code Character.isLetter(0x2F81A)} returns
 * {@code true} because the code point value represents a letter
 * (a CJK ideograph).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In the Java SE API documentation, <em>Unicode code point</em> is
 * used for character values in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,
 * and <em>Unicode code unit</em> is used for 16-bit
 * {@code char} values that are code units of the <em>UTF-16</em>
 * encoding. For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">Unicode Glossary</a>.
