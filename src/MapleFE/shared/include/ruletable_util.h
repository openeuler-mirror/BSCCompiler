// This file contains all the functions that are used when we traverse the
// rule tables. Most of the functions are designed to do the following
// 1. Validity check
//    e.g. if an identifier is a type name, variable name, ...
// 2. Traverse the rule tables

// This class contains all the functions that a language could use during parsing.
// The mechansim behind this design has three major parts.
//
//   1. ValidityCheck is the parent class of the children classes, say JavaValidityCheck.
//      ValidityCheck has some common implementations, and children can have their own.
//
//      A language can have its own special syntax checking, e.g., Java Type Argument has
//      wildcard synatx, such as ? extend SomeClass, and we need check if two type
//      arguments are equal, containing, contained, or distinct.
//
//   2. Children's validity checking is language specific, eg Java has a requirement to
//      check if an identifier is a packagename. The package names are specific in each
//      language.
//
//   3. The hard problem is how to invoke the correct functions when a rule is matched.
//      The most straightforward idea is to put the function pointers in the rule table
//      with additional information. However, the signatures of a function makes the idea
//      complicated.
//      
//      So I finally decided to have an Id for each check function, and Id is written into
//      the rule tables by Autogen.

public:
  virtual bool IsPackageName();
  virtual bool IsTypeName();
  virtual bool IsVariable();
