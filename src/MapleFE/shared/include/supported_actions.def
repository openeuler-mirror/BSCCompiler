// This file defines Rule Actions supported in both Autogen and Parser. The cooperation between
// all modules are as below.
// 1. The Action names in .spec files should be one of Actions below.
// 2. Autogen generates rule tables in gen_xxx.h/cpp files. It user ActionId.
// 3. AST maintains a table which is basically a mapping between ActionId and the corresponding
//    utility functions.
// 4. The utility functions will (1) do the validation (2) create the tree node.
//
// [NOTE] This file only contains actions to create common tree node seen in most programming
//        languages. If a language has tree nodes not covered here, they can be defined in its
//        dedicated directory.
//
// [Format] The Format tells the parameters it needs when writing .spec files.
//          It also shows the internal parameters when parser creates the AST tree node.
//          Please refer autogen/README.ACTIONS for details.
